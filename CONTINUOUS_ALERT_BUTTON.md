isAlertPlaying: boolean      // Is sound playing?
alertInterval: IntervalId    // Interval for continuous beeping
```

### Functions:
```javascript
stopAlert()                  // User clicks to stop
// - Sets isAlertPlaying = false
// - Clears alertInterval

### Cleanup:

useEffect cleanup            // On component unmount
// - Clears alertInterval if exists
// - Prevents memory leaks
```

### Interval Logic:
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  alertSound.play()          // Play beep
}, 1000)                     // Every 1 second

// Continues until:
// 1. User clicks STOP button, OR
// 2. Balance becomes positive, OR
// 3. Component unmounts
