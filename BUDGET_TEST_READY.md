## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Budget Still Shows $0:

1. **Check you're logged in as test user**:
   - Email: test@test.com
   - Should show "Welcome, Test User" in navbar

2. **Check transactions exist**:
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Should see 4 transactions (1 income, 3 Food expenses)

3. **Check budget exists**:
   - Go to Budget tab
   - Should see 1 Food budget card

4. **Check console (F12)**:
   - Should see calculation logs
   - Look for errors in red

5. **Refresh page**:
   - Click "Refresh Data" button
   - Or hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

### If Categories Don't Match:

The budget category must **exactly** match transaction category:
```
✅ Budget: "Food" + Transaction: "Food" = MATCH
✅ Budget: "Food" + Transaction: "food" = MATCH (case-insensitive)
❌ Budget: "Food" + Transaction: "Foods" = NO MATCH
❌ Budget: "Food" + Transaction: "Food & Dining" = NO MATCH
```
