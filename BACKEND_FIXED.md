# ✅ Backend Fixed & Running!

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### Issue
The backend wasn't starting because:
- MongoDB connection string needed to be updated with your actual credentials
- JWT_SECRET was a placeholder value
- Server needed to be started from correct directory

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Updated `backend/.env` with your MongoDB Atlas connection:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://simran24:simran6789g@mycluster.36hc0ze.mongodb.net/expense-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=MyCluster
   ```

2. ✅ Generated secure JWT secret:
   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=f8e3d2c1b0a9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98
   ```

3. ✅ Started backend server successfully

```javascript
// User Document
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Your Name",
  email: "your@email.com",
  passwordHash: "bcrypt_hashed_password",
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-28T...")
}

// Transaction Document
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  userId: ObjectId("..."),
  type: "expense",
  category: "Food",
  amount: 50,
  description: "Lunch at restaurant",
  date: ISODate("2025-10-28T..."),
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-28T...")
}
```
