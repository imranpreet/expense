## ✅ Feature 2: Budget Alert System

### What Was Added:
Automatic budget monitoring system that detects when expenses exceed income and provides visual + audio alerts.

### How It Works:

#### 1. **Automatic Detection**
- System continuously monitors all transactions
- Calculates total income vs total expenses
- Detects when expenses > income

#### 2. **Visual Alert (Red Box)**
When budget is exceeded:
- **Balance card turns RED** (red-600 to red-700 gradient)
- **Pulsing animation** applied to the card
- **Ring effect** with red glow around the card
- **Warning message box** appears:
  ```
  ⚠️ ALERT: Expenses exceed income!
  You've spent more than you earned. Review your budget!
  ```
- **Status changes** to "Over Budget - Take Action!"
- **Animated icons** pulse to draw attention

#### 3. **Audio Alert (30 Seconds)**
When budget is exceeded:
- **Beep sound plays** automatically
- **800 Hz frequency** sine wave tone
- **Repeats every 1 second** for 30 seconds
- **30 total beeps** to ensure user notices
- Uses Web Audio API for reliable sound playback

#### 4. **Color Coding System**
The balance card shows different colors based on status:
- **🟣 Purple/Pink Gradient**: Healthy balance (income > expenses)
- **🟠 Orange/Red Gradient**: Budget deficit (income < expenses but positive balance)
- **🔴 Bright Red with Pulse**: ALERT - Expenses exceed income!

### Visual States:

**Normal State (Green/Purple):**
```
✓ Healthy balance
- Purple/pink gradient
- Check icon
- No alerts
```

**Deficit State (Orange/Red):**
```
⚠ Budget deficit
- Orange/red gradient
- Warning icon
- Negative balance shown
```

**ALERT State (Bright Red + Pulse):**
```
⚠️ ALERT: Expenses exceed income!
- Bright red gradient
- Pulsing animation
- Ring glow effect
- Warning message box
- Beeping sound (30 seconds)
- "Over Budget - Take Action!" status
```

### Technical Implementation:
- **Web Audio API**: Creates beep sounds dynamically
- **useEffect Hook**: Monitors transaction changes
- **State Management**: `budgetExceeded` boolean state
- **CSS Animations**: `animate-pulse-slow`, `animate-bounce-slow`
- **Conditional Styling**: Dynamic className based on budget status
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Stops beeping after 30 seconds

### User Benefits:
✅ **Immediate Awareness**: Can't miss when overspending
✅ **Visual Prominence**: Red pulsing box draws attention
✅ **Audio Reinforcement**: 30-second beep ensures user notices
✅ **Clear Messaging**: Explains the issue and suggests action
✅ **Motivational**: Encourages better financial management
