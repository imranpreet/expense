# 💰 Budget Planner - Transaction-Based Tracking Guide

## ✅ How It Works (Your Requirement)

Your budget planner is now **100% transaction-based**. Here's exactly how it calculates:

### Example Scenario (Your Case):

```
📊 Your Finances:
- Income: $3,000
- Food Expenses (from transactions): $1,500
- Remaining Balance: $1,500

🎯 Create Budget:
- Category: Food
- Budget Limit: $1,000
- Period: Monthly

📈 Budget Display Will Show:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🍕 Food                             │
│    MONTHLY                          │
│                                     │
│ $1,500              of $1,000       │
│ █████████████████████████ 150%     │
│                                     │
│ ✗ Over Budget                 150% │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

📊 Top Summary Cards:
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│ Total Budget    │  │ Total Spent     │  │ Over Budget     │
│   $1,000        │  │   $1,500        │  │   -$500         │
│ 1 category      │  │ 150% used       │  │ Exceeding       │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
                                             (Red/Orange!)
```

## 🔍 How Calculation Works

### Step 1: Fetch All Expense Transactions
```javascript
// Only expense transactions are counted (not income)
const expenses = transactions.filter(t => t.type === 'expense')
```

### Step 2: Match by Category & Date
```javascript
For Food budget:
✅ Category: "Food" (case-insensitive)
✅ Date: Within budget period (10/29/2025 - 11/28/2025)

Transactions counted:
- Oct 30: Food $200 ✅
- Nov 5:  Food $350 ✅
- Nov 12: Food $450 ✅
- Nov 20: Food $500 ✅
Total: $1,500

Transactions NOT counted:
- Nov 5: Transport $100 ❌ (wrong category)
- Oct 15: Food $50 ❌ (before budget start date)
- Income $3,000 ❌ (income, not expense)
```

### Step 3: Calculate Totals
```javascript
Total Budget Limit: $1,000 (what you set)
Total Actual Spent: $1,500 (from Food transactions)
Remaining: $1,000 - $1,500 = -$500 (OVER BUDGET!)
```
