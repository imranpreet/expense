# Login Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Backend is Working!

The backend server is running correctly and login is working. Here's proof:

```bash
# Backend logs show successful login:
Login attempt for email: test@test.com
User found, checking password...
Login successful for: test@test.com
```

## 🔍 Why You're Getting "Invalid Credentials"

There are a few common reasons:

### 1. **You Haven't Created an Account Yet**
- **Solution**: Click "Create account" first before trying to login
- The test account (test@test.com / test123) works, but you need YOUR OWN account

### 2. **Email or Password Typo**
- **Solution**: Check for:
  - Extra spaces before/after email or password
  - Wrong capitalization (email should be lowercase)
  - Copy-pasting issues

### 3. **Different Email Than Signup**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using the EXACT same email you signed up with

## 🚀 How to Fix It

### Step 1: Create a New Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3002/
2. Click "Create account" (if you see it)
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Your Name
   - **Email**: your@email.com
   - **Password**: yourpassword123
4. Click "Sign up"

### Step 2: Use Those Same Credentials to Login
1. Use the EXACT same email and password you just created
2. Click "Login"

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Try logging in again
4. You should see:
   ```
   Making request to: http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login
   Response: {token: "...", user: {...}}
   ```

## 📝 Better Error Messages

I've updated the backend to show MORE SPECIFIC error messages:
- ❌ "Invalid credentials - user not found" → Email doesn't exist
- ❌ "Invalid credentials - incorrect password" → Wrong password
- ❌ "Email and password are required" → Missing fields

## 🧪 Test Account

If you want to test quickly, I've already created a test account:
- **Email**: test@test.com
- **Password**: test123

Try this in the browser!

## 🔧 Still Having Issues?

If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check the backend terminal** (it shows detailed logs now):
   ```bash
   tail -f /home/sama/Desktop/Expense-Tracker/backend/backend.log
   ```

2. **Try the API directly**:
   ```bash
   # Test signup
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/signup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Your Name","email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpass"}'
   
   # Test login
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpass"}'
   ```

3. **Check browser console** for error details

4. **Tell me the exact error message** you see in:
   - The browser alert
   - The browser console (F12)
   - The backend log file
