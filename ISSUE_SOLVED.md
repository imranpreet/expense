1. The form switches to "Create account"
2. A "Full Name" field appears
3. Fill in your name, email, and password
4. Click "Create Account"
5. Done! You'll be logged in automatically

### **OR: Click "Sign up" Manually**

At the bottom of the login form, you'll see:

Don't have an account? Sign up
```
Click "Sign up" to create your account.
